- Add test files for each service
- Implement CI/CD test automation
- Target 80% code coverage

### 2. Error Handling Standardization üü°
**Current State**: Inconsistent error handling
**Recommendation**: Implement standard error patterns
- Create error handling utilities
- Standardize logging patterns
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Add user-friendly error messages

### 3. Performance Optimization üü°
**Current State**: Some scripts lack optimization
**Recommendation**: Implement performance best practices
- Batch API operations

## Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. **Linter compliance**: Some scripts still have linting issues
2. **Legacy code**: Some scripts contain outdated patterns
3. **Duplicate functionality**: Some scripts have overlapping features
4. **Configuration management**: Need centralized config system

### Medium Priority
1. **Documentation gaps**: Some complex scripts need better docs
2. **Code reusability**: Common functions should be extracted
3. **Versioning**: Need version management strategy
4. **Deployment automation**: Improve deployment scripts

### Low Priority
1. **Code formatting**: Minor inconsistencies remain
2. **Naming edge cases**: Few scripts need name refinement
3. **Comment standardization**: Some comments need updates
4. **File organization**: Minor folder structure improvements
