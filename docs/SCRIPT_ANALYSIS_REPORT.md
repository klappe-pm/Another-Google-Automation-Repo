## Naming Rules

1. **Action-Noun Format**: Files should be named with action-noun (e.g., export-labels, create-folders)
2. **Markdown Exception**: Scripts that create/modify markdown should start with "markdown-"
3. **No Service Prefix**: Remove gmail-, drive-, etc. prefixes (use folder structure instead)
4. **Kebab Case**: Use hyphens, not camelCase or underscores
5. **Descriptive Names**: Replace generic names (temp-script, untitled, code) with descriptive ones
