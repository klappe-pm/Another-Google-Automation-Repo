# Plan to Refactor, Test, and Standardize Google Apps Scripts Repo

## Notes
- User wants to refactor, test, and standardize a repository of Google Apps Scripts.
- Repository location: /Users/kevinlappe/Documents/GitHub/Workspace Automation/scripts
- Initial attempt to search for .gs files in /Users/kevinlappe/Obsidian encountered an error due to search pattern or hidden files.
- Repo contains service-specific directories (gmail, drive, calendar, etc.) and a README describing standards, naming conventions, and documentation headers.
- Successfully located .gs script files in all service directories using command-line search.
- Began analysis of sample script (gmail-analysis-markdown-yaml-v2.gs) for code quality and standardization opportunities.
- User requested comprehensive review of the entire repo at /Users/kevinlappe/Documents/GitHub/Workspace Automation against best practices (organization, documentation, testing, version control, security, etc.).
- Repository includes a tools directory with deployment, validation, and security scripts; further code samples (e.g., drive-yaml-add-frontmatter-bulk.gs) have been reviewed for code structure and documentation practices.
- Comprehensive audit of repository structure, code samples, version control, and tooling is substantially complete. Ready to synthesize findings and prioritize improvements.
- All scripts must retain a code summary at the top per standard.
- Inline code comments are required throughout all scripts.
- Each script must link to a Markdown file with detailed usage instructions.
- Next priority: Apply documentation templates and style guides to scripts and docs.
- Documentation templates and style guides for scripts and usage docs have been created in /docs/templates.
- Script template (script-template.gs) has been created in /docs/templates following the new standards.
- Robust debugging, plain English error messages with descriptive debugging steps, and comprehensive logging are required for all scripts and must be reflected in style guides/templates.
- Batch processing must be used as a best practice to avoid timeout limits (to be included in style guides and templates, and required by validation tool).
- Script validation tool (script-validator.js) has been created to check scripts for compliance with standards (header, comments, logging, error handling, batch processing, usage link, etc.).
- Coding standards document (performance and best practices) has been created and integrated with documentation system (/docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md).
- Coding standards document has been integrated with the documentation system.
- Script template now includes explicit requirements for caching, security, and performance in headers and configuration.
- Coding standards document integration has been confirmed.
- Coding standards examples document has been created and integrated with the documentation system (/docs/CODING_STANDARDS_EXAMPLES.md).
- Begin analysis of Google-provided Apps Script samples at /Users/kevinlappe/Documents/GitHub/apps-script-samples-main to extract best practices, examples, and areas for improvement. Plan to update those files as needed.
- Search for all Code.gs files across the Google Apps Script samples repo has been performed to identify scripts for best practices extraction and updates.
- Initial review of chat/quickstart and gmail-sentiment-analysis sample files has begun; extracting best practices and identifying areas for improvement in these and other sample files is underway.
- Analysis document (ANALYSIS_GOOGLE_SAMPLES.md) summarizing best practices, areas for improvement, specific files to update, and an implementation plan has been created for the Google Apps Script samples.
- Validation script (validate-google-samples.js) created to check Google Apps Script samples for compliance with documentation, error handling, performance, and security standards.
- Validation script fixed for correct directory traversal and is ready for use.
- Validation script has been successfully run; compliance report for Google Apps Script samples generated (samples-validation-report.md). Ready to define and update files as required.
- Compliance report reviewed; files needing updates are being defined. Next step: begin updating identified files in the Google Apps Script samples repo.
- Update script (update-google-samples.js) created and run; Google Apps Script sample files have been updated according to compliance report. Next step: review and validate changes.
- Review and validation of updated Google Apps Script sample files completed; all files updated to meet standards and validated with no errors. Project ready for final documentation and closeout.
- Final implementation summary document created (GOOGLE_SCRIPTS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md). Project is now complete and ready for closure.
- Review of all style guides and standards documentation is underway to ensure the complete set of standards is accurately reflected.
- Standalone documentation standards and performance standards documents have been created. Next: create error handling and testing standards documents.
- Standalone security standards and code organization standards documents have been created. Next: create error handling and testing standards documents.
- Standalone error handling and testing standards documents have been created. All major standards areas are now documented in standalone files.
- All standards documents have been moved and renamed with dashes to /Users/kevinlappe/Documents/GitHub/Standards as specified. Project standards documentation is now fully organized and consolidated.
- Project is fully complete: all standards, code, and documentation are consolidated and no outstanding goals remain.
