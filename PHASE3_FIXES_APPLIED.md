# CI/CD Phase 3 Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Cloud Build Configuration Path
- **Issue**: deploy-with-status.yml referenced `.github/workflows/cloudbuild.yml` (wrong path)
- **Fix**: Updated to use `cloudbuild.yaml` in repository root
- **Impact**: Deployment workflow will now find correct Cloud Build configuration

### 2. ✅ Apps Script Project IDs Updated
- **Issue**: Several .clasp.json files had incorrect or placeholder script IDs
- **Fix**: Updated all files with correct script IDs from project documentation
- **Services Updated**: Calendar, Docs, Drive, Gmail, Sheets, Tasks, Slides

### 3. ✅ Missing Slides Directory Created
- **Issue**: Slides service directory was missing despite having script ID
- **Fix**: Created `projects/slides/` directory with proper .clasp.json configuration
- **Impact**: Complete service coverage for all documented Apps Script projects

### 4. ✅ Conflicting Cloud Build File Removed
- **Issue**: Duplicate cloudbuild.yml in .github/workflows/ conflicted with root cloudbuild.yaml
- **Fix**: Moved conflicting file to .bak extension
- **Impact**: Eliminates confusion between Docker and Apps Script build configurations

## Remaining Manual Actions Required

### Create Missing Google Apps Script Projects
The following services need new Apps Script projects created manually:

1. **Chat Service**: Replace `1PLACEHOLDER_CHAT_ID_NEEDS_UPDATE`
2. **Photos Service**: Replace `1PLACEHOLDER_PHOTOS_ID_NEEDS_UPDATE`  
3. **Utility Service**: Replace `1PLACEHOLDER_UTILITY_ID_NEEDS_UPDATE`

## Expected CI/CD Pipeline Status

### Should Now Work
- ✅ Workflow YAML syntax validation
- ✅ Cloud Build path resolution
- ✅ Apps Script deployment for documented services
- ✅ Authentication to Google Cloud APIs

### May Still Fail
- ❌ Apps Script deployment to placeholder services (Chat, Photos, Utility)
- ❌ Any missing clasp credentials in Secret Manager

## Testing Approach
This commit will test:
1. Workflow file syntax validation
2. Cloud Build configuration loading
3. Apps Script API authentication  
4. Deployment pipeline functionality

Any remaining failures will provide clear next steps for final resolution.
