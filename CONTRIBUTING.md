## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

#### File Naming Convention
All scripts must follow the established pattern:
```
{service}-{function}-{descriptor}.gs
```

Examples:
- `gmail-export-pdf-markdown.gs`
- `drive-index-all-files.gs`
- `calendar-analysis-duration-distance.gs`

#### Script Header Requirements
Every script must include this standardized header:

```javascript
/**
 * Title: {Descriptive Script Name}
 * Service: {Google Service}
 * Purpose: {Primary function and goal}
 * Created: {Creation date}
 * Updated: {Last modification date}
 * Author: {Your Name}
 * Contact: {Your Email}
 * License: MIT
 */

/*
Script Summary:
- Purpose: {Detailed purpose explanation}
- Description: {What the script does}
- Problem Solved: {Specific problem addressed}
- Successful Execution: {Expected outcomes}
*/
```

#### Code Quality Standards
- **Error Handling**: Include comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Logging**: Implement detailed console logging for debugging
- **Comments**: Add inline comments for complex logic
- **Variables**: Use descriptive variable names
- **Constants**: Define configuration constants at the top

### Documentation Requirements

#### README Updates
When adding new scripts:
1. Update the service-specific README.md
2. Add script to the main repository README.md
3. Include usage examples and configuration instructions
4. Document any new dependencies or API requirements

#### Script Documentation
Each script should include:
- Clear purpose statement
- Parameter descriptions
- Return value documentation
- Usage examples
- Error handling information
- Performance considerations

### Testing Guidelines

#### Required Testing
Before submitting a pull request:
1. **Functionality Test**: Verify script works as intended
2. **Permission Test**: Confirm required API permissions
3. **Error Test**: Test error handling with invalid inputs
4. **Performance Test**: Verify reasonable execution times
5. **Integration Test**: Test with other scripts if applicable

#### Test Documentation
Include in your PR:
- Test scenarios executed
- Expected vs actual results
- Any limitations or known issues
- Performance benchmarks if relevant

### 2. Branch Strategy
- Create feature branches from `main`
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/gmail-bulk-export`
- Keep branches focused on single features/fixes
- Rebase before submitting PRs

### 3. Pull Request Process
1. **Pre-submission Checklist**:
   - [ ] Code follows established conventions
   - [ ] All tests pass

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### Service Folders
Each Google service has its own folder structure:
```
{service}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Analysis Tools/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Export Functions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Content Management/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Utility Tools/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Legacy Files/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE.md
```

### Script Categories
Scripts are organized by function type:
- **Analysis Tools**: Data analysis and reporting
- **Export Functions**: Data export and conversion
- **Content Management**: Content creation and processing
- **Utility Tools**: Helper functions and maintenance
- **Integration Tools**: Third-party service connections

## üö® Security Guidelines

### Sensitive Information
- **Never commit**: API keys, passwords, personal data
- **Use placeholders**: Replace sensitive values with examples
- **Environment variables**: Reference configuration patterns
