# Automation Directory Structure

This directory has been reorganized into 4 main functional categories for better organization and maintainability.

## Directory Structure

```

├── tools/              # Development and maintenance tools
│   ├── formatters/     # Code formatting and styling tools
│   ├── gas-tools/      # Google Apps Script specific tools
│   └── migration-tools/ # Project migration utilities
├── deployment/         # Deployment and setup scripts
│   ├── scripts/        # Deployment automation scripts
│   └── setup/          # Environment setup and configuration
├── validation/         # Testing, validation, and quality assurance
│   ├── javascript/     # JavaScript validators and linters

│   └── dev-tools/      # Development validation tools
└── utilities/          # General utilities and helpers
    ├── git-automation/ # Git workflow automation
    ├── config/         # Configuration files and settings

    └── shell-readme.md     # Original Shell tools documentation
```

## Folder Purposes

### 1. tools/
**Purpose**: Development and maintenance tools for code quality and project management
- **formatters/**: Scripts for code formatting, header standardization, and file cleanup
- **gas-tools/**: Google Apps Script project management, downloading, and cataloging
- **migration-tools/**: Tools for migrating and merging project versions

### 2. deployment/
**Purpose**: Scripts for deploying, setting up, and configuring the automation environment
- **scripts/**: Deployment automation, manifest management, and project mapping
- **setup/**: Environment setup, GitHub Actions, Git hooks, and verification scripts

### 3. validation/
**Purpose**: Quality assurance, testing, and security validation
- **javascript/**: JavaScript linters, validators, and script analysis tools
- **security/**: Security scanning and comprehensive security validation
- **dev-tools/**: Development environment validation and configuration tools

### 4. utilities/
**Purpose**: General-purpose utilities and workflow automation
- **git-automation/**: Git workflow automation, syncing, and repository management
- **config/**: Configuration files and deployment status tracking
- **Documentation**: Preserved README files from original structure

## Migration Notes

- Original `javascript/` directory contents distributed across tools/, validation/, and utilities/
- Original `shell/` directory contents distributed across deployment/, validation/, and utilities/  
- Original `config/` and `dev-tools/` moved to appropriate functional categories
- Empty `shell-scripts/` directory removed
- All original README files preserved in utilities/ for reference

## Old Directory Backup

The original directory structure has been backed up to `/Users/kevinlappe/Documents/old_automation_dirs/` and can be safely deleted once the new structure is verified.

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Functional Organization**: Files grouped by purpose rather than file type
2. **Clearer Navigation**: Easier to find tools for specific tasks
3. **Better Maintenance**: Related functionality kept together
4. **Scalability**: New tools can be easily categorized and added
5. **Documentation**: Clear purpose for each directory and subdirectory
