### Day 13: Calendar & Sheets
**Outcome**: Two more services migrated

**Actions**:
1. Parallel migration of both services
2. Calendar: 6 scripts
3. Sheets: 10 scripts
4. Integration testing

### Day 14: Remaining Services
**Outcome**: All services using library

**Actions**:
1. Migrate Chat, Docs, Photos, Tasks, Utility
2. Verify all dependencies
3. Run full system test

**Actions**:
1. End-to-end testing
2. Cross-service verification
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Bug fixes

## Week 4: Cleanup & Optimization

### Day 16-17: Code Cleanup
**Outcome**: Removed duplicate code

**Actions**:
1. Delete deprecated functions
2. Remove .backup files
3. Clean up src-pending directories
4. Update file organization

**Impact**: ~70% code reduction

### Day 18: Documentation
**Outcome**: Complete documentation

**Actions**:
1. Update README files
2. Create migration guide
3. Document new architecture
4. Update CLAUDE.md

### Day 19: Performance Optimization
**Outcome**: Optimized library usage

**Actions**:
1. Identify performance bottlenecks
2. Implement caching where needed
3. Batch operations optimization
4. Final performance testing

### Day 20: Production Deployment
**Outcome**: Library architecture in production

**Actions**:
1. Final review
2. Production deployment
3. Monitor for issues
4. Rollback plan ready
