## Decisions Made

### DECISION-001: Use Google Apps Script Libraries for Code Sharing
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Status**: Approved
**Impact**: High

**Decision**:
Implement Google Apps Script's native Library feature for sharing code between services.

**Rationale**:
- Native solution designed for this exact use case
- No workarounds or hacks required
- Supports versioning and rollback
- Maintains service isolation for security
- Google-supported and documented

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Build process to concatenate files** - Rejected: Complex build pipeline, loses service isolation
2. **Monolithic single project** - Rejected: Loses independent deployment, security boundaries
3. **Copy shared code during deployment** - Rejected: Still duplicates code at runtime
4. **External package manager** - Rejected: Not supported by Google Apps Script

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Clean architecture with proper separation
- ✅ Version control for shared code
- ✅ Easy rollback capability
- ⚠️ Small performance overhead (~1-2ms per call)
- ⚠️ Must learn library deployment process

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create separate Script project for library
- Publish with versioning
- Update services to import library

### DECISION-002: Start Migration with Gmail Service
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Status**: Approved
**Impact**: High

**Decision**:
Begin service migration with Gmail (47 scripts) despite being most complex.

**Rationale**:
- Highest code duplication (247 functions)
- Maximum impact on code reduction
- Proves approach works with hardest case
- Sets patterns for other services
- Most valuable learning experience

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Start with simplest (Calendar)** - Rejected: Low impact, doesn't prove scalability
2. **Parallel migration** - Rejected: Too risky without proven patterns
3. **Drive service first** - Rejected: Gmail has more duplication

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Immediate high-value impact
- ✅ Establishes patterns for all services
- ✅ Identifies issues early
- ⚠️ Higher initial risk
- ⚠️ Longer first migration

**Implementation Notes**:
- Phase Gmail migration over multiple days
- Start with utility functions
- Progress to complex operations

### DECISION-003: Implement Fallback Mechanisms During Migration
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Status**: Approved
**Impact**: Medium

**Decision**:
Add fallback to local functions if library calls fail during migration period.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures zero downtime during migration
- Allows gradual rollout
- Provides safety net for issues
- Enables A/B testing of implementations

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Direct replacement** - Rejected: Too risky, no safety net
2. **Feature flags** - Rejected: Overcomplicated for temporary need
3. **Parallel systems** - Rejected: Too much complexity

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Safe migration path
- ✅ Can rollback instantly
- ✅ Testing in production possible
- ⚠️ Temporary code complexity
- ⚠️ Must remember to remove fallbacks

**Implementation Notes**:
```javascript
function formatDate(date) {
  try {
    if (typeof CommonLib !== 'undefined') {
      return CommonLib.formatDate(date);
    }
  } catch (e) {
    // Fallback to original
  }
  return originalFormatDate(date);
}
```

### DECISION-004: Use Development Mode During Migration
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Status**: Approved
**Impact**: Medium

**Decision**:
Set `developmentMode: true` for library dependencies during migration phase.

**Rationale**:
- Always use latest library code
- No need to version during rapid changes
- Simplifies development workflow
- Can fix issues immediately

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Version every change** - Rejected: Too much overhead during development
2. **Manual version updates** - Rejected: Error-prone, slow
3. **Automated versioning** - Rejected: Unnecessary complexity during migration

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Rapid iteration possible
- ✅ Immediate bug fixes
- ✅ Simplified development
- ⚠️ Less stable during migration
- ⚠️ Must switch to versioned for production

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use `developmentMode: true` during migration
- Switch to specific version before production
- Document version in each service

### DECISION-005: Maintain Existing Script IDs
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Status**: Approved
**Impact**: High

**Decision**:
Keep all existing Script IDs unchanged, only add library dependency.

**Rationale**:
- No disruption to existing integrations
- Triggers continue working
- Web apps maintain URLs
- No permission re-authorization needed
- Simpler migration path

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Create new projects** - Rejected: Would break all integrations
2. **Consolidate projects** - Rejected: Loses service isolation
3. **Rename projects** - Rejected: Unnecessary risk

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Zero disruption to users
- ✅ Existing automations continue
- ✅ No reconfiguration needed
- ✅ Rollback is simple

**Implementation Notes**:
- Only modify appsscript.json
- Don't change .clasp.json
- Keep project structure intact

### DECISION-006: Batch Operations to Minimize Library Calls
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Status**: Approved
**Impact**: Medium

**Decision**:
Design library API to accept arrays/batches rather than individual items.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces cross-context call overhead
- Better performance for large datasets
- Aligns with Google Apps Script best practices
- Enables timeout management

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Individual function calls** - Rejected: Too much overhead
2. **Async/await patterns** - Rejected: Not fully supported in Apps Script
3. **Generator functions** - Rejected: Not supported in Apps Script

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Timeout protection built-in
- ✅ Cleaner API design
- ⚠️ Requires refactoring loops
- ⚠️ Different programming pattern

**Implementation Notes**:
```javascript
// Instead of:
items.forEach(item => CommonLib.process(item));

// Use:
CommonLib.processBatch(items);
```

## Pending Decisions

### DECISION-007: Library Function Naming Convention
**Date**: TBD
**Status**: Proposed
**Impact**: Low

**Decision**:
Need to decide on consistent naming convention for library functions.

**Options**:
1. camelCase (JavaScript standard)
2. snake_case (Python-like)
3. PascalCase (Class-like)

**Considerations**:
- Consistency with existing code
- Google Apps Script conventions
- Developer preferences

### DECISION-008: Error Handling Strategy
**Date**: TBD
**Status**: Proposed
**Impact**: Medium

**Decision**:
Standardize error handling across all services.

**Options**:
1. Throw and catch at service level
2. Return error objects
3. Log and continue
4. Hybrid approach

**Considerations**:
- User experience
- Debugging ease
- System stability
