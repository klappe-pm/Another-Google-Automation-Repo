# Google Apps Script Library Refactoring Project Charter

## Project Information
- **Project Name**: Google Apps Script Library Architecture Implementation
- **Project Code**: REFACTOR-2025-08
- **Start Date**: August 1, 2025
- **Project Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Project Lead**: Kevin Lappe

## Current State & Problem Definition

### The Reality Today
You have 100+ Google Apps Script files operating in complete isolation. Each script reimplements basic functions like date formatting, error handling, and data validation. When a bug is found in a common pattern, you must fix it in dozens of places. When you need to add a feature, you copy-paste code and hope you remembered all the edge cases from the last implementation.

### The Core Problem
**Google Apps Script's deployment model creates isolated runtime environments**. Each service (Gmail, Drive, Calendar) deploys to its own Script ID, creating independent containers that cannot share code. Your GitHub repository gives an illusion of organization, but at runtime, these scripts cannot communicate or share utilities.

## Desired Future State

### What Success Looks Like
A single source of truth for common functionality. When you fix a bug in date formatting, it's fixed everywhere. When you add a new utility function, every service can immediately use it. Your deployment pipeline understands dependencies and handles library versioning automatically.

### Key Outcomes

#### Outcome 1: Unified Code Base
**Impact**: Developers work with one set of utilities instead of maintaining dozens of copies
- One place to fix bugs
- One place to add features
- One place to document functionality
- Consistent behavior across all services

#### Outcome 2: Sustainable Growth
**Impact**: Adding new automation scripts becomes trivial
- New services automatically inherit all utilities
- No need to copy-paste foundational code
- Focus on business logic, not boilerplate
- Reduced cognitive load for developers

#### Outcome 3: Reliable Deployments
**Impact**: Confidence in production changes
- Library versioning enables safe rollbacks
- Services can pin to stable library versions
- Gradual rollout of changes possible
- Failed deployments don't affect all services

#### Outcome 4: Maintainable System
**Impact**: Reduced time investigating and fixing issues
- Clear separation of concerns
- Predictable code organization
- Centralized logging and error handling
- Single point for security updates

## Implementation Approach

### The Library Architecture Solution

Google Apps Script supports Libraries - a mechanism for sharing code between projects. We will:

1. **Create a Central Library** containing all shared utilities
2. **Publish it as a versioned library** accessible to all services
3. **Update each service** to import and use the library
4. **Modify deployment pipeline** to handle library versioning

### Why This Approach Works
- Native Google Apps Script feature (no workarounds)
- Maintains service isolation (security boundary intact)
- Supports versioning (can rollback if needed)
- Minimal changes to existing deployment infrastructure

## Project Phases & Expected Impacts

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**What Happens**: Create and deploy the Common Library
**Impact**: Shared utilities become available but not yet used
**Outcome**: Foundation ready for migration

### Phase 2: Pioneer Migration (Week 2)
**What Happens**: Migrate Gmail service (most complex) to use library
**Impact**: Prove the approach works with the hardest case
**Outcome**: Template for remaining migrations, confidence in approach

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Week 3)
**What Happens**: Migrate all remaining services
**Impact**: Entire system using shared code
**Outcome**: Dramatic reduction in code duplication

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 4)
**What Happens**: Remove deprecated code, optimize library, update documentation
**Impact**: Clean, maintainable codebase
**Outcome**: System ready for long-term sustainability

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Library becomes unavailable
**Impact**: Services cannot execute
**Mitigation**: Implement fallback to local functions during migration

**Risk**: Performance degradation from library calls
**Impact**: Slower script execution
**Mitigation**: Batch operations, minimize cross-context calls

**Risk**: Breaking changes during migration
**Impact**: Service disruption
**Mitigation**: Parallel testing, gradual rollout, version pinning

### Organizational Risks

**Risk**: Incomplete migration due to complexity
**Impact**: Partial benefits, continued maintenance burden
**Mitigation**: Start with highest-value services, incremental approach

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Technical Dependencies
- Google Apps Script Library functionality
- Existing Script IDs must remain unchanged
- Cloud Build pipeline must continue to function
- GitHub repository structure preservation

### Constraints
- Cannot change authentication mechanism
- Must maintain service isolation
- Existing scripts must continue working during migration
- No changes to Google Cloud project configuration

## Definition of Done

### Project Completion Criteria
- Common Library deployed and versioned
- All services successfully importing library
- Deprecated duplicate code removed
- Documentation reflects new architecture
- Deployment pipeline handles library versioning
- Rollback procedure tested and documented

### Long-term Success Indicators
- Adding new utilities requires one change, not ten
- Bug fixes propagate to all services automatically
- New team members understand code organization quickly
- Deployment confidence increases
- Maintenance time decreases

## Communication & Governance

### Decision Making
- Technical decisions: Project Lead
- Deployment timing: Based on testing results
- Rollback triggers: Any service degradation

### Progress Tracking
- Daily commits to feature branches
- Weekly integration to develop branch
- Phase completion marked by merge to main
- Documentation updated continuously

## Project Justification

### Why Now?
1. **Technical debt is compounding** - Each new script adds more duplication
2. **Maintenance burden growing** - Bug fixes take increasingly longer
3. **Security updates needed** - Must be applied in many places
4. **Team scalability** - Current approach doesn't scale with complexity

### Why This Approach?
1. **Native solution** - Uses Google's intended sharing mechanism
2. **Proven pattern** - Libraries are the standard solution
3. **Reversible** - Can rollback if needed
4. **Incremental** - Can be done service by service

### Cost of Inaction
- Continued multiplication of bugs
- Increasing time to implement features
- Growing security vulnerability surface
- Developer frustration and errors
- Eventually unmaintainable system
