## Active Issues

### ISSUE-001: Script ID Exposure in Version Control
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Affected Component**: All Services

**Description**:
Script IDs are currently exposed in project-mapping.json and .clasp.json files, creating a security vulnerability.

**Impact**:
- Potential unauthorized access to scripts
- Security audit failure risk

**Root Cause**:
Original architecture didn't consider security implications of public repository

**Solution**:
1. Move Script IDs to environment variables
2. Use Cloud Build substitutions
3. Update .gitignore to exclude .clasp.json files
4. Store IDs in Secret Manager

**Prevention**:
- Security review for all configuration files
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

**Related Files**:
- project-mapping.json
- apps/*/.clasp.json
- cloudbuild.yaml

## Potential Issues (Anticipated)

### ISSUE-002: Library Call Performance Overhead
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Monitoring
**Affected Component**: Library

**Description**:
Each library function call has ~1-2ms overhead due to cross-context execution.

**Impact**:
- Potential performance degradation for high-frequency calls
- Possible timeout issues for large datasets

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Batch operations to minimize calls
2. Cache library results where possible
3. Keep critical high-frequency functions local
4. Monitor performance metrics

**Trigger Conditions**:
- More than 1000 library calls per execution
- Execution time increase >20%

### ISSUE-003: Google 6-Minute Execution Limit
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Monitoring
**Affected Component**: Gmail, Drive services

**Description**:
Large data processing operations risk hitting Google's 6-minute execution limit.

**Impact**:
- Incomplete data processing
- Service failures for large operations

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Implement checkpoint/resume functionality
2. Use CommonLib.processBatches() with timeout protection
3. Add progress tracking to Script Properties
4. Consider using time-driven triggers for continuation

**High-Risk Operations**:
- gmail-analysis-24months.gs (processes all emails)
- drive-index-all-files.gs (indexes entire drive)

### ISSUE-004: Library Version Conflicts
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Monitoring
**Affected Component**: All Services

**Description**:
Services might require different library versions during migration.

**Impact**:
- Services may break if forced to use incompatible version
- Deployment complexity increases

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Use developmentMode during migration
2. Implement backward compatibility in library
3. Version services independently
4. Test version combinations

## Escalation Path

### Severity Definitions
- **Critical**: Blocks all work, requires immediate attention
- **High**: Blocks service migration, needs resolution within 24 hours
- **Medium**: Affects functionality, should be resolved within week
- **Low**: Minor issue, can be addressed after migration

### Escalation Process
1. **Critical**: Stop current work, all focus on resolution
2. **High**: Prioritize in next work session
3. **Medium**: Schedule for current week
4. **Low**: Add to backlog

---

## Risk Register

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Library Deployment**: First-time deployment critical
2. **Gmail Migration**: Most complex service, 47 scripts
3. **Performance**: Unknown impact of library calls
4. **Rollback**: Must be able to revert quickly

### Monitoring Points
- After each service migration
- Daily during first week of production
- Performance metrics comparison
- Error rate tracking
