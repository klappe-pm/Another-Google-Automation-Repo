# Script Restoration Log

## Issue: Missing/Stub Scripts in Google Apps Script Projects

### Problem Identified
- Gmail, Photos, and Chat were reported as not pushing properly
- Gmail had 47 stub files instead of actual scripts
- Scripts existed in backup folder but not in projects/src folders

### Root Cause
The Gmail scripts in `projects/gmail/src/` were placeholder/stub files generated automatically, not the actual functional scripts. The real scripts were in the `scripts-backup-20250723` folder.

### Actions Taken

1. **Restored Gmail Scripts**: Copied 47 actual scripts from backup folders:
   - Export Functions (9 scripts)
   - Analysis Tools (7 scripts)  
   - Label Management (15 scripts)
   - Utility Tools (4 scripts)
   - Legacy Files (12 scripts)

2. **Created Missing HTML File**: Added `dialog.html` for Gmail UI functionality

3. **Verified Other Services**: 
   - Calendar: 5 scripts ✅
   - Chat: 1 script ✅
   - Docs: 6 scripts ✅
   - Drive: 26 scripts ✅
   - Gmail: 47 scripts ✅ (after restoration)
   - Photos: 1 script ✅
   - Sheets: 9 scripts ✅
   - Slides: 0 scripts (intentionally empty)
   - Tasks: 3 scripts ✅
   - Utility: 1 script ✅

### Final Script Count: 99 Total Scripts

### Deployment Result
All 10 projects deployed successfully with complete functionality restored.

### Verification Steps
1. Check Google Apps Script console for each project
2. Verify script count matches local files
3. Test basic functionality of key scripts

### Next Steps
- Commit restored scripts to version control
- Document proper backup/restore procedures
- Consider removing scripts-backup folder after verification
