 ✗ [MEDIUM] Command Injection
   Finding ID: 84b43369-ee65-4f0d-8a1a-224b59696846
   Path: tools/repository/version-manager.js, line 353
   Info: Unsanitized input from a command line argument flows into child_process.execSync, where it is used to build a shell command. Forwarding command-line arguments or file paths from the local environment to a function that executes a system command can change the meaning of the command unexpectedly due to unescaped special characters, which may result in a Indirect Command Injection vulnerability.
