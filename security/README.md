## 🔍 Security Scanning Coverage

### Google Apps Script Analysis
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: API keys, passwords, tokens
- **Insecure Patterns**: eval(), innerHTML, dangerous functions
- **API Security**: Google API usage validation
- **Input Validation**: User input handling
- **Documentation**: Security header compliance

### Dependency Security
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Known CVEs in npm packages
- **License Compliance**: Open source license validation
- **Outdated Packages**: Dependencies needing updates
- **Supply Chain Security**: Package integrity verification

### Infrastructure Security
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow security validation
- **Configuration Files**: Secure defaults verification
- **Secrets Management**: Credential handling assessment
- **Access Controls**: Permission minimization

## 🚨 Vulnerability Severity Levels

### Critical 🚨
- Hardcoded API keys or credentials
- Google OAuth token exposure
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Data breach potential

**Action Required**: Immediate fix (within 24 hours)

### High ⚠️
- Insecure coding patterns (eval, innerHTML)
- Privilege escalation possibilities
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypass

**Action Required**: Fix within 1 week

### Medium 📋
- Missing input validation
- Information disclosure
- Insecure configurations
- Missing error handling

**Action Required**: Fix within 2 weeks

### Low ℹ️
- Documentation issues
- Best practice violations
- Minor information leakage
- Code quality concerns

**Action Required**: Fix in next development cycle

## 🔐 GitHub Actions Setup

### Required Secrets

Add these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

1. **SNYK_TOKEN**
   - Go to https://app.snyk.io/account
   - Copy your API token
   - Add as repository secret

2. **SNYK_ORG_ID** (Optional but recommended)
   - Find your organization ID in Snyk dashboard
   - Add as repository secret for better project organization

### Workflow Triggers

- **Push to main/develop**: Full security scan
