# Milestone 1: Pipeline Validation Log

## Date: 2025-07-25
## Branch: feature/milestone-1-pipeline-validation

### Objective
Verify CI/CD pipeline is fully functional and all 10 Google Apps Script projects deploy successfully.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed Configuration Issues
- **Fixed**: Gmail .clasp.json had invalid JSON comment (line 4)
  - Changed: `"projectId": "784508074368 // i added this in the apps script project directly",`
  - To: `"projectId": "784508074368",`

#### 2. Updated project-mapping.json
- **Added**: All 10 services with correct script IDs from README
- **Added**: Status field for each service (all marked as "active")
- **Updated**: Script IDs to match those in individual .clasp.json files

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [x] All .clasp.json files have valid JSON syntax
- [x] All script IDs match between README and .clasp.json files
- [x] project-mapping.json contains all 10 services
- [ ] Cloud Build authentication verified
- [ ] Manual deployment test completed

### Next Steps
1. Test manual Cloud Build deployment
2. Document any errors encountered
3. Verify Apps Script console shows updates

### Notes
- .clasp.json files are gitignored, so configuration changes won't be tracked in git
- This is intentional for security - credentials should not be in version control
