## Branch Strategy: Trunk-based Development with Feature Branches

### Branch Structure
```
main (trunk)
├── feature/user-authentication-refactor
├── feature/payment-service-redesign
├── feature/database-optimization
└── release/v2.0.0
```

### Branching Rules
1. **Main Branch (`main`)**
   - Always deployable
   - Protected with required reviews
   - Automated testing required
   - Direct commits prohibited

2. **Feature Branches**
   - Short-lived (max 3-5 days)
   - Named with prefix `feature/` + descriptive name
   - Must be up-to-date with main before merge
   - Require at least 2 approvals for merge

3. **Release Branches**
   - Created from main for release preparation
   - Named with prefix `release/` + version number
   - Only bug fixes and release preparation allowed
   - Merged back to main after release

### Merge Strategy
- **Small, frequent merges** (multiple times per day)
- **Squash and merge** for feature branches
- **Merge commits** for release branches
- **Automated testing** on all merges

### Code Review Process
1. Create pull request from feature branch
2. Automated checks must pass (tests, linting, security scan)
3. Minimum 2 reviewers required
4. Address all feedback before merge
5. Delete feature branch after successful merge

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Legacy dependencies**: Create migration plan with fallback options
- **Data integrity**: Implement comprehensive backup and rollback procedures
- **Performance degradation**: Establish performance baselines and monitoring

### Process Risks
- **Scope creep**: Strict change control process with approval gates
- **Resource availability**: Cross-training and knowledge documentation
- **Timeline delays**: Weekly progress tracking with early warning system

## Approval Process

### Charter Approval
- [ ] Executive Sponsor approval
- [ ] Technical Lead approval
- [ ] Project Manager approval
- [ ] Architecture Team approval

### Change Management
- Minor changes: Technical Lead approval
- Major changes: Steering Committee approval
- Scope changes: Executive Sponsor approval
